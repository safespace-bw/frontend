# Safespace 

# Frontend

This was my first group project at Lambda School as the Front End Developer and second group project overall. I have moved my portion of the project into my own repository here to continue to work on it in deployment as I do not have control of deployment or PR's in the team repository.

The MVP of this project was to build out a web application that consumes a CRUD API. I pair programmed with the UI Developers and Back End Developers on my team to ensure that all of my React components were wired up in proper fashion. The stretch goal of this app was to connect to the Twilio API in order to send out positive text reminders throughout the day. We unfortunately did not have the time to complete that feature as the project was only a few days long, however this is something I would like to incorporate in the future.

Overall, this project was a good lesson in creating a React app from scratch. I fleshed the app out with functional and class components as well as array methods to dynamically render the elements. I also incorporated my newly acquired knowledge of react-router when I made this project and learned more about how CRUD operations drive an application.

# The 4 week unit at Lambda School that I was in prior to creating this project was the Web Application Development Unit. During this unit, I explored the following topics:

- Functional Components 1 - 2
- Class Components 1-2
- React Tooling
- The React Life-cycle
- React Composition Patterns
- CSS in JS
- React Router 1 - 2
- HTTP/AJAX 1 - 2
- Redux Fundamentals 1 - 2
- Async Redux w/ Redux Thunk

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
